# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to employ different machine learning algorithm techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes to determine which sampling method and model should be used to predict credit risk. We are using the models to compare with LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. We used six models - RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.


## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

### Evaluation 

- Random Oversampling

The balanced accuracy was 65.72%.
As you can see, the precision score is low for high-risk class with just 1%. In comparison, it is high for the low-risk class (100%). 
The recall score  is similar to one another.



### 

## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
